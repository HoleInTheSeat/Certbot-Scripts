# You must have your cloudflare API token somewhere on your machine and must make sure the script is pointing to it

The script above points to `/home/packetfence/.secrets/cloudflare.ini` for the cloudflare credentials, but you may want to change that.
cloudflare has documentation on how to get an api token [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/)
Its not recommended to use a global api key
